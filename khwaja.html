                <h2>The Illustrious Lineage and Early Life</h2>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.), revered as HabibAllah (the Beloved of Allah), was born into a noble and radiant lineage, tracing directly to the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through both his maternal (Hassani) and paternal (Hussaini) lines.</p>
                
                <p>His father, Khwaja Ghiyasuddin Hasan (R.A.), was a direct descendant of Hazrat Imam Hussain (A.S.), the beloved son of Hazrat Ali (K.W.K.). His mother, Umm-ul-Warah (R.A.), affectionately known as Bibi Mah Noor, connected his lineage to Hazrat Imam Hasan (A.S.). This profound ancestry underscores his spiritual eminence and the divine blessings bestowed upon him.</p>
                
                <p>Born in the region of Sistan, a land often gripped by unrest due to invasions, his family migrated to the spiritually vibrant and intellectually rich lands of Khūrāsan, seeking peace and knowledge. From a tender age, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) radiated compassion and divine sensitivity. His innate generosity was evident even as a child; on Eid, he would give his own clothes to a blind child and accompany him to prayer. He preferred sharing meals with others over play, foreshadowing his future as a profound giver of divine love and a patron of the poor.</p>
                
                <p>His early education began within the sacred confines of his home, where he memorized the Holy Qur\`an by the age of nine. He later immersed himself in Hadith and Fiqh at a maktab, completing his studies with remarkable intellectual brilliance and divine blessing. At the age of fifteen, he experienced the heart-wrenching loss of his father during the Tatar invasions in Khorasan. This sorrow deeply etched into his soul, planting the seed of spiritual yearning that would ultimately shape his entire life and mission.</p>
                
                <h3>The Transformative Spiritual Journey</h3>
                
                <p>One fateful day, in the sacred season between Sha\`aban and Zul-Hijjah of 544 AH / 1150 AD, while tending to his orchard, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) received an unexpected guest: the noble mystic, Hazrat Ibrahim Qandoozi (R.A.). With the warmth of a true host, Khwaja Sahib offered him a bunch of grapes. Moved by this affection, Hazrat Qandoozi (R.A.) offered him a simple piece of oil cake. That humble offering, given in divine silence, awakened in Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) an intense yearning for truth—a pivotal moment that irrevocably altered the course of history and set him on his unparalleled spiritual path.</p>
                
                <p>After his father\`s passing, he inherited only a grindstone and a small orchard. Yet, these modest possessions held no attachment for him. Driven by an overwhelming love for the Divine, he sold them and distributed all proceeds to the poor, orphans, and the destitute. This act of profound selflessness symbolized his detachment from worldly possessions and his complete surrender to the Divine Will, setting ablaze his ego and firmly placing him on the path of spiritual asceticism.</p>
                
                <p>Thirsting for deeper wisdom, he embarked on extensive journeys to the sacred cities of Baghdad, Samarkand, and Bukhara—luminous centers of Islamic learning. For five years, he diligently studied under esteemed scholars such as Maulana Hisamuddin of Bukhara (R.A.) and Maulana Sharfuddin (R.A.), meticulously polishing both his intellect and spirit. His soul, however, continued to yearn for a deeper connection.</p>
                
                <p>His quest led him farther, from Iraq to the blessed lands of Arabia and Iran, until he reached Haroon. There, Divine Providence orchestrated his meeting with Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.)—the revered master whose spiritual gaze had the power to transform hearts. Entrusting him with the profound secrets of the Path, Hazrat Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.) accepted him as a devoted disciple. For two and a half years, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) remained under his rigorous care, undergoing intensive spiritual training and ascetic discipline. This period culminated in him being granted Khilafat—the spiritual license to guide seekers on the Sufi path.</p>
                
                <h3>Initiation, Hajj, and the Divine Mandate</h3>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) himself recounts the luminous details of his second spiritual initiation:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "I, Moinuddin Hasan of Sanjar, a well-wisher of the faithful, had the honor of meeting His Holiness Hazrat Khwaja Usman of Haroon in the mosque of Khwaja Junaid in Baghdad. He was surrounded by divinely inspired dervishes. When this humble soul bowed in reverence, my master and guide asked me to offer two rak\`ats. I obeyed. Then he instructed me to face the Ka\`ba and recite Surah Baqarah. I did so. Next, he told me to send salutations upon the Beloved Prophet ﷺ twenty-one times. I obeyed. He then rose, held my hand, lifted his gaze towards the heavens and said, \`Come, let me cause thee to reach God.\` Taking out a miqraz, he passed it over my head and placed upon me the four-edged cap and bestowed the blessed robe of the path. Then he said, \`It is our tradition that a seeker must undergo a day and night of spiritual abstinence. You shall complete this now.\` I obeyed."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>After twenty years of dedicated service to his revered spiritual guide and teacher, Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) reached a profound turning point at the age of fifty-two in Baghdad. On this significant occasion, Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.) honored him with the distinguished title of Sajjada Nashin, marking him as the spiritual successor. Along with this esteemed appointment, he was entrusted with the sacred relics of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>
                
                <h3>The Divine Spiritual Lineage (Silsila)</h3>
                
                <p>The divine spiritual chain (Silsila) of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) is a testament to the unbroken transmission of spiritual knowledge and blessings, tracing directly back to the Beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This sacred lineage is as follows:</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Prophet\`s Deputy (Nayab-e-Rasool): The Divine Mandate to India</h3>
                
                <p>After receiving the robe of caliphate from his spiritual guide and teacher, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) embarked once more on a journey of sacred travels. He first reached Osh and then moved towards Isfahan, where he met Sheikh Mahmud of Isfahan. It was here that he gave the clothes he was wearing to Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (R.A.), symbolizing his spiritual acceptance of him as a devoted disciple. From that moment in 583 AH / 1187 AD, Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (R.A.) became his inseparable companion and spiritual heir.</p>
                
                <p>That same year, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) left Isfahan for Makkah. While absorbed in prayer at the Holy Ka\`ba, a divine voice resonated:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! We are greatly pleased with thee. Thou art given salvation. Ask for anything thou may\`st like, so that We may grant that to thee."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>With profound humility, he responded:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Great God! Grant salvation to the followers and disciples of Moinuddin."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The reply came, confirming his exalted status:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! Thou art Our accepted one. I will give salvation to thy followers and disciples, and also to those who may enter thy fold till the Day of Resurrection."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>After completing Hajj and offering his heartfelt salutations at the Ka\`ba, he traveled to Medina and immersed himself in prayers at the Prophet\`s Mosque. There, he received a direct spiritual mandate from the Court of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! Thou art a helper of My religion. I entrust to thee the country of Hindustan. There prevails darkness. Proceed to Ajmer and spread there the Gospel of Truth."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Deeply honored yet initially unsure of where Ajmer lay, he was soon enveloped in a spiritual dream in which the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ revealed to him the city, its fort, and the surrounding landscape of Ajmer. Before departing, he was presented with a pomegranate from Heaven, a symbol of divine blessing and abundance for his mission.</p>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) then reached Baghdad, and from there passed through Chisht on his way to Herat. Continuing his sacred mission, he traveled to Sabzevar, where even the ruler of the region became his spiritual disciple. From Sabzevar, he journeyed to Shadman Fort, then proceeded to Lahore via Multan. Eventually, he reached Delhi, pausing briefly at Samana in the Patiala district, and finally arrived in Ajmer for the first time in 587 AH / 1191 AD, accompanied by forty devoted followers, marking the beginning of a new spiritual era in India.</p>
                
                <h3>His Blessed Visit and Impact in Ajmer</h3>
                
                <p>Upon his arrival in Ajmer, then under the rule of a powerful king, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) sought to reside at the location where the Auliya Mosque now stands. However, the king\`s attendants objected, claiming it was a resting place for the royal camels. In response, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may Allah be pleased with him) fearlessly stated, "If the camels sit there, let them sit." He instead settled on a nearby hill, now famously known as Chillah Khwaja Sahib.</p>
                
                <p>Miraculously, the camels, upon returning to their usual spot, were unable to rise after sitting down. Upon being informed, the king was summoned, and all camel-drivers humbly apologized. Accepting their repentance, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his blessings be upon him) said, "Very well, go ahead, the camels can now stand." Upon their return, the camels were found standing, a testament to his spiritual power and divine favor.</p>
                
                <p>News of the arrival of this deeply pious dervish spread rapidly, attracting an increasing number of people to him. Whoever approached him was greeted with profound kindness and bestowed with blessings. Inspired by his divine teachings, his simple yet profound wisdom, and his compassionate demeanor, many embraced Islam and became his devoted disciples, transforming the spiritual landscape of the region.</p>
                
                <p>During Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti\`s (may Allah be pleased with him) stay in Ajmer, Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori launched another invasion of India in 1192 AD. In the famous Battle of Tarain, he emerged victorious over the local king. Upon learning of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti\`s (may his soul be sanctified) presence in Ajmer, Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori personally visited him and received his blessings, acknowledging the saint\`s spiritual authority.</p>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) left Ajmer for brief periods, returning in 588 AH/1191 AD. He journeyed to Baghdad in 598 AH/1200 AD and, upon reaching Balkh, accepted Maulana Ziauddin (may Allah be pleased with him) as his spiritual disciple. Subsequently, he revisited Ajmer in 602 AH/1206 AD and again in 610 AH/1213 AD.</p>
                
                <p>During the reign of Sultan Shamsuddin Iltutmish, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) visited Delhi twice. In 611 AH/1214 AD, he resided in the Khanqah of Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (may Allah be pleased with him) and granted Hazrat Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar (may Allah be pleased with him) a robe during his stay, signifying the passing of spiritual authority.</p>
