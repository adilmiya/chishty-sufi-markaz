                <h2>The Illustrious Lineage and Early Life</h2>
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.), revered as HabibAllah (the Beloved of Allah), was born into a noble and radiant lineage, tracing directly to the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through both his maternal (Hassani) and paternal (Hussaini) lines.</p>
                
                <p>His father, Khwaja Ghiyasuddin Hasan (R.A.), was a direct descendant of Hazrat Imam Hussain (A.S.), the beloved son of Hazrat Ali (K.W.K.). His mother, Umm-ul-Warah (R.A.), affectionately known as Bibi Mah Noor, connected his lineage to Hazrat Imam Hasan (A.S.). This profound ancestry underscores his spiritual eminence and the divine blessings bestowed upon him.</p>
                
                <p>Born in the region of Sistan, a land often gripped by unrest due to invasions, his family migrated to the spiritually vibrant and intellectually rich lands of Khorasan, seeking peace and knowledge. From a tender age, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) radiated compassion and divine sensitivity. His innate generosity was evident even as a child; on Eid, he would give his own clothes to a blind child and accompany him to prayer. He preferred sharing meals with others over play, foreshadowing his future as a profound giver of divine love and a patron of the poor.</p>
                
                <p>His early education began within the sacred confines of his home, where he memorized the Holy Qur\'an by the age of nine. He later immersed himself in Hadith and Fiqh at a maktab, completing his studies with remarkable intellectual brilliance and divine blessing. At the age of fifteen, he experienced the heart-wrenching loss of his father during the Tatar invasions in Khorasan. This sorrow deeply etched into his soul, planting the seed of spiritual yearning that would ultimately shape his entire life and mission.</p>

                <h2>The Transformative Spiritual Journey</h2>
                <p>One fateful day, in the sacred season between Sha\'aban and Zul-Hijjah of 544 AH / 1150 AD, while tending to his orchard, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) received an unexpected guest: the noble mystic, Hazrat Ibrahim Qandoozi (R.A.). With the warmth of a true host, Khwaja Sahib offered him a bunch of grapes. Moved by this affection, Hazrat Qandoozi (R.A.) offered him a simple piece of oil cake. That humble offering, given in divine silence, awakened in Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) an intense yearning for truth—a pivotal moment that irrevocably altered the course of history and set him on his unparalleled spiritual path.</p>
                
                <p>After his father\'s passing, he inherited only a grindstone and a small orchard. Yet, these modest possessions held no attachment for him. Driven by an overwhelming love for the Divine, he sold them and distributed all proceeds to the poor, orphans, and the destitute. This act of profound selflessness symbolized his detachment from worldly possessions and his complete surrender to the Divine Will, setting ablaze his ego and firmly placing him on the path of spiritual asceticism.</p>
                
                <p>Thirsting for deeper wisdom, he embarked on extensive journeys to the sacred cities of Baghdad, Samarkand, and Bukhara—luminous centers of Islamic learning. For five years, he diligently studied under esteemed scholars such as Maulana Hisamuddin of Bukhara (R.A.) and Maulana Sharfuddin (R.A.), meticulously polishing both his intellect and spirit. His soul, however, continued to yearn for a deeper connection.</p>

                <h2>The Divine Spiritual Lineage (Silsila)</h2>
                <p>The divine spiritual chain (Silsila) of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) is a testament to the unbroken transmission of spiritual knowledge and blessings, tracing directly back to the Beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This sacred lineage is as follows:</p>

                <h2>Prophet\'s Deputy (Nayab-e-Rasool): The Divine Mandate to India</h2>
                <p>After receiving the robe of caliphate from his spiritual guide and teacher, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) embarked once more on a journey of sacred travels. While absorbed in prayer at the Holy Ka\'ba, a divine voice resonated:</p>
                
                <blockquote>"O, Moinuddin! We are greatly pleased with thee. Thou art given salvation. Ask for anything thou may\'st like, so that We may grant that to thee."</blockquote>
                
                <p>With profound humility, he responded:</p>
                
                <blockquote>"O, Great God! Grant salvation to the followers and disciples of Moinuddin."</blockquote>
                
                <p>The reply came, confirming his exalted status:</p>
                
                <blockquote>"O, Moinuddin! Thou art Our accepted one. I will give salvation to thy followers and disciples, and also to those who may enter thy fold till the Day of Resurrection."</blockquote>
                
                <p>After completing Hajj and offering his heartfelt salutations at the Ka\'ba, he traveled to Medina and immersed himself in prayers at the Prophet\'s Mosque. There, he received a direct spiritual mandate from the Court of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:</p>
                
                <blockquote>"O, Moinuddin! Thou art a helper of My religion. I entrust to thee the country of Hindustan. There prevails darkness. Proceed to Ajmer and spread there the Gospel of Truth."</blockquote>
                
                <p>Deeply honored yet initially unsure of where Ajmer lay, he was soon enveloped in a spiritual dream in which the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ revealed to him the city, its fort, and the surrounding landscape of Ajmer. Before departing, he was presented with a pomegranate from Heaven, a symbol of divine blessing and abundance for his mission.</p>

                <h2>His Blessed Visit and Impact in Ajmer</h2>
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) finally arrived in Ajmer for the first time in 587 AH / 1191 AD, accompanied by forty devoted followers, marking the beginning of a new spiritual era in India.</p>
                
                <p>Upon his arrival in Ajmer, then under the rule of a powerful king, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) sought to reside at the location where the Auliya Mosque now stands. However, the king\'s attendants objected, claiming it was a resting place for the royal camels. In response, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may Allah be pleased with him) fearlessly stated, "If the camels sit there, let them sit." He instead settled on a nearby hill, now famously known as Chillah Khwaja Sahib.</p>
                
                <p>Miraculously, the camels, upon returning to their usual spot, were unable to rise after sitting down. Upon being informed, the king was summoned, and all camel-drivers humbly apologized. Accepting their repentance, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his blessings be upon him) said, "Very well, go ahead, the camels can now stand." Upon their return, the camels were found standing, a testament to his spiritual power and divine favor.</p>

                <h2>Blessed Character and Enduring Legacy</h2>
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) is adorned with a myriad of titles, each reflecting his exalted spiritual status and profound impact on humanity. These include:</p>

                <h3>Spiritual Works and Literary Legacy</h3>
                <p>These luminous compositions, all penned in the sacred Persian language, include:</p>

It is the profound inner life, the transformation of the heart and soul, that truly distinguishes a mystic. A genuine mystic must possess a precise and deep understanding of divine knowledge. They should completely surrender their individual will to the Divine Will of God.</p>

Whatever comes in it is burnt and becomes annihilated. There is no fire greater in intensity than the fire of love. The sign of true love is manifested in obedience to and the fear of the Friend."</p>

According to him, prayer encompasses selfless service, profound sympathy, and genuine fellow-feeling. Thus, actively helping the weak, the aggrieved, the needy, feeding the hungry, and working to free the captive all constitute the highest forms of prayer.</p>

                        <p>The knowledge of the realm of divine power (Jabrut) is called Haqeeqat. The knowledge of Jabrut signifies an intimate closeness with the Divine.</p>

                <h3>Ecstasy of Sama (Music): A Sacred Connection</h3>
                <p>When love radiates within the heart of a seeker, encompassing the realm of divine power and ecstasy, it becomes spiritually permissible for them to rise and enter into ecstatic movement during Sama (spiritual music). However, in the domain of worldly existence (Alam-e-Nasut), such expression is prohibited (haram), and within the angelic realm (Alam-e-Malkut), it is deemed detestable (makrooh).</p>
                
                <p>Three conditions must be fulfilled for the Sama to be spiritually effective:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> The heart must be detached from worldly concerns and basic physical needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Place:</strong> The gathering must be free from the heedless, the oppressors, those who abandon prayer, and the ignorant of the Deen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> It must include seekers devoted to one Shaykh, one Silsila (spiritual lineage), or those united in path or divine attribute.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Sufi music creates a sixfold sacred connection: The heart with pure love, The hidden with witnessing, The soul with unity, The body with service, The eyes with vision, The ears with the sound of the Beloved.</p>
                
                <h3>Blessed Sayings of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (R.A.)</h3>
                
                <div class="sayings">
                    <blockquote>"The heart of a lover, the true devotee of Allah, is ablaze with the fire of Divine Love, such that any worldly passion daring to intrude upon its sanctity is reduced to ashes."</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>"Blessed is the true lover of Allah, adorned with three divine attributes: Charity like a river—his generosity flows without end, nourishing every creation that comes near. Affection like the sun—his love shines upon all indiscriminately, warming every heart. Hospitality like the earth—his embrace is as vast and accepting as the earth itself."</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>"To sit in the company of the pious is greater than performing virtuous deeds. Conversely, association with the wicked is worse than committing sin."</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>"Among all worship, the most beloved to Allah is to bring solace to the humble and the oppressed."</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>"The Path of Love demands total self-loss. Those who truly love Allah sacrifice both worlds—and yet feel they have done nothing."</blockquote>
                    
                    <blockquote>"To walk the Way, two things suffice: Devotion in worship and Obedience in action."</blockquote>

                        <p>The sixth day of URS, known as Chhati Sharif, is the most significant day when the actual Wisaal is commemorated. Special prayers, Qawwali sessions, and distribution of blessed food (Tabarruk) take place.</p>
                        <p>The sixth day of the Urs holds a paramount significance and is regarded as highly auspicious. Referred to as "Chhati Sharif," this day unfolds on the 6th of Rajab, commencing from 10:00 A.M. until 1:30 p.m., within the precincts of the Mazaar Sharif or the shrine complex. This solemn occasion encompasses the reading of the Shijra, the genealogical lineage linked to the Chishti Order, by the devoted Khadims of Moinuddin Chishti. This is followed by Fariyad, the offering of prayers.</p>
                        <p>Preceding the Qu\'l, the culmination of Chhati Sharif, a rendition of RUNG, a poetic ode of praise, resonates at the main entrance of the shrine, performed by the Qawwals. This RUNG, a recitation accompanied solely by rhythmic clapping, including the use of musical instruments. Following its recitation, the Qu\'l ceremony reaches its conclusion, and Fatiha is recited. The conclusion of this ceremony is heralded by the firing of a cannon at precisely 1:30 p.m.</p>
