                <h2>The Illustrious Lineage and Early Life</h2>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.), revered as HabibAllah (the Beloved of Allah), was born into a noble and radiant lineage, tracing directly to the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through both his maternal (Hassani) and paternal (Hussaini) lines.</p>
                
                <p>His father, Khwaja Ghiyasuddin Hasan (R.A.), was a direct descendant of Hazrat Imam Hussain (A.S.), the beloved son of Hazrat Ali (K.W.K.). His mother, Umm-ul-Warah (R.A.), affectionately known as Bibi Mah Noor, connected his lineage to Hazrat Imam Hasan (A.S.). This profound ancestry underscores his spiritual eminence and the divine blessings bestowed upon him.</p>
                
                <p>Born in the region of Sistan, a land often gripped by unrest due to invasions, his family migrated to the spiritually vibrant and intellectually rich lands of Khūrāsan, seeking peace and knowledge. From a tender age, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) radiated compassion and divine sensitivity. His innate generosity was evident even as a child; on Eid, he would give his own clothes to a blind child and accompany him to prayer. He preferred sharing meals with others over play, foreshadowing his future as a profound giver of divine love and a patron of the poor.</p>
                
                <p>His early education began within the sacred confines of his home, where he memorized the Holy Qur'an by the age of nine. He later immersed himself in Hadith and Fiqh at a maktab, completing his studies with remarkable intellectual brilliance and divine blessing. At the age of fifteen, he experienced the heart-wrenching loss of his father during the Tatar invasions in Khorasan. This sorrow deeply etched into his soul, planting the seed of spiritual yearning that would ultimately shape his entire life and mission.</p>
                
                <h3>The Transformative Spiritual Journey</h3>
                
                <p>One fateful day, in the sacred season between Sha'aban and Zul-Hijjah of 544 AH / 1150 AD, while tending to his orchard, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) received an unexpected guest: the noble mystic, Hazrat Ibrahim Qandoozi (R.A.). With the warmth of a true host, Khwaja Sahib offered him a bunch of grapes. Moved by this affection, Hazrat Qandoozi (R.A.) offered him a simple piece of oil cake. That humble offering, given in divine silence, awakened in Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) an intense yearning for truth—a pivotal moment that irrevocably altered the course of history and set him on his unparalleled spiritual path.</p>
                
                <p>After his father's passing, he inherited only a grindstone and a small orchard. Yet, these modest possessions held no attachment for him. Driven by an overwhelming love for the Divine, he sold them and distributed all proceeds to the poor, orphans, and the destitute. This act of profound selflessness symbolized his detachment from worldly possessions and his complete surrender to the Divine Will, setting ablaze his ego and firmly placing him on the path of spiritual asceticism.</p>
                
                <p>Thirsting for deeper wisdom, he embarked on extensive journeys to the sacred cities of Baghdad, Samarkand, and Bukhara—luminous centers of Islamic learning. For five years, he diligently studied under esteemed scholars such as Maulana Hisamuddin of Bukhara (R.A.) and Maulana Sharfuddin (R.A.), meticulously polishing both his intellect and spirit. His soul, however, continued to yearn for a deeper connection.</p>
                
                <p>His quest led him farther, from Iraq to the blessed lands of Arabia and Iran, until he reached Haroon. There, Divine Providence orchestrated his meeting with Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.)—the revered master whose spiritual gaze had the power to transform hearts. Entrusting him with the profound secrets of the Path, Hazrat Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.) accepted him as a devoted disciple. For two and a half years, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) remained under his rigorous care, undergoing intensive spiritual training and ascetic discipline. This period culminated in him being granted Khilafat—the spiritual license to guide seekers on the Sufi path.</p>
                
                <h3>Initiation, Hajj, and the Divine Mandate</h3>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) himself recounts the luminous details of his second spiritual initiation:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "I, Moinuddin Hasan of Sanjar, a well-wisher of the faithful, had the honor of meeting His Holiness Hazrat Khwaja Usman of Haroon in the mosque of Khwaja Junaid in Baghdad. He was surrounded by divinely inspired dervishes. When this humble soul bowed in reverence, my master and guide asked me to offer two rak'ats. I obeyed. Then he instructed me to face the Ka'ba and recite Surah Baqarah. I did so. Next, he told me to send salutations upon the Beloved Prophet ﷺ twenty-one times. I obeyed. He then rose, held my hand, lifted his gaze towards the heavens and said, 'Come, let me cause thee to reach God.' Taking out a miqraz, he passed it over my head and placed upon me the four-edged cap and bestowed the blessed robe of the path. Then he said, 'It is our tradition that a seeker must undergo a day and night of spiritual abstinence. You shall complete this now.' I obeyed."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>After twenty years of dedicated service to his revered spiritual guide and teacher, Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) reached a profound turning point at the age of fifty-two in Baghdad. On this significant occasion, Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harooni (Q.S.A.) honored him with the distinguished title of Sajjada Nashin, marking him as the spiritual successor. Along with this esteemed appointment, he was entrusted with the sacred relics of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.</p>
                
                <h3>The Divine Spiritual Lineage (Silsila)</h3>
                
                <p>The divine spiritual chain (Silsila) of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) is a testament to the unbroken transmission of spiritual knowledge and blessings, tracing directly back to the Beloved Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This sacred lineage is as follows:</p>
                
                <ul class="spiritual-lineage">

                </ul>
                
                <h3>Prophet's Deputy (Nayab-e-Rasool): The Divine Mandate to India</h3>
                
                <p>After receiving the robe of caliphate from his spiritual guide and teacher, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) embarked once more on a journey of sacred travels. He first reached Osh and then moved towards Isfahan, where he met Sheikh Mahmud of Isfahan. It was here that he gave the clothes he was wearing to Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (R.A.), symbolizing his spiritual acceptance of him as a devoted disciple. From that moment in 583 AH / 1187 AD, Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (R.A.) became his inseparable companion and spiritual heir.</p>
                
                <p>That same year, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) left Isfahan for Makkah. While absorbed in prayer at the Holy Ka'ba, a divine voice resonated:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! We are greatly pleased with thee. Thou art given salvation. Ask for anything thou may'st like, so that We may grant that to thee."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>With profound humility, he responded:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Great God! Grant salvation to the followers and disciples of Moinuddin."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>The reply came, confirming his exalted status:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! Thou art Our accepted one. I will give salvation to thy followers and disciples, and also to those who may enter thy fold till the Day of Resurrection."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>After completing Hajj and offering his heartfelt salutations at the Ka'ba, he traveled to Medina and immersed himself in prayers at the Prophet's Mosque. There, he received a direct spiritual mandate from the Court of the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "O, Moinuddin! Thou art a helper of My religion. I entrust to thee the country of Hindustan. There prevails darkness. Proceed to Ajmer and spread there the Gospel of Truth."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Deeply honored yet initially unsure of where Ajmer lay, he was soon enveloped in a spiritual dream in which the Holy Prophet Muhammad ﷺ revealed to him the city, its fort, and the surrounding landscape of Ajmer. Before departing, he was presented with a pomegranate from Heaven, a symbol of divine blessing and abundance for his mission.</p>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.) then reached Baghdad, and from there passed through Chisht on his way to Herat. Continuing his sacred mission, he traveled to Sabzevar, where even the ruler of the region became his spiritual disciple. From Sabzevar, he journeyed to Shadman Fort, then proceeded to Lahore via Multan. Eventually, he reached Delhi, pausing briefly at Samana in the Patiala district, and finally arrived in Ajmer for the first time in 587 AH / 1191 AD, accompanied by forty devoted followers, marking the beginning of a new spiritual era in India.</p>
                
                <h3>His Blessed Visit and Impact in Ajmer</h3>
                
                <p>Upon his arrival in Ajmer, then under the rule of a powerful king, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) sought to reside at the location where the Auliya Mosque now stands. However, the king's attendants objected, claiming it was a resting place for the royal camels. In response, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may Allah be pleased with him) fearlessly stated, "If the camels sit there, let them sit." He instead settled on a nearby hill, now famously known as Chillah Khwaja Sahib.</p>
                
                <p>Miraculously, the camels, upon returning to their usual spot, were unable to rise after sitting down. Upon being informed, the king was summoned, and all camel-drivers humbly apologized. Accepting their repentance, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his blessings be upon him) said, "Very well, go ahead, the camels can now stand." Upon their return, the camels were found standing, a testament to his spiritual power and divine favor.</p>
                
                <p>News of the arrival of this deeply pious dervish spread rapidly, attracting an increasing number of people to him. Whoever approached him was greeted with profound kindness and bestowed with blessings. Inspired by his divine teachings, his simple yet profound wisdom, and his compassionate demeanor, many embraced Islam and became his devoted disciples, transforming the spiritual landscape of the region.</p>
                
                <p>During Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's (may Allah be pleased with him) stay in Ajmer, Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori launched another invasion of India in 1192 AD. In the famous Battle of Tarain, he emerged victorious over the local king. Upon learning of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti's (may his soul be sanctified) presence in Ajmer, Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori personally visited him and received his blessings, acknowledging the saint's spiritual authority.</p>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) left Ajmer for brief periods, returning in 588 AH/1191 AD. He journeyed to Baghdad in 598 AH/1200 AD and, upon reaching Balkh, accepted Maulana Ziauddin (may Allah be pleased with him) as his spiritual disciple. Subsequently, he revisited Ajmer in 602 AH/1206 AD and again in 610 AH/1213 AD.</p>
                
                <p>During the reign of Sultan Shamsuddin Iltutmish, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (may his soul be sanctified) visited Delhi twice. In 611 AH/1214 AD, he resided in the Khanqah of Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (may Allah be pleased with him) and granted Hazrat Baba Fariduddin Ganjshakar (may Allah be pleased with him) a robe during his stay, signifying the passing of spiritual authority.</p>

                <h2>The Profound Spiritual Teachings</h2>
                
                <h3>Spiritual Works and Literary Legacy</h3>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.), a revered Sufi Saint, has bequeathed a priceless collection of Persian poetry and other profound written works. These luminous compositions, all penned in the sacred Persian language, include:</p>
                
                <ul class="literary-works">
                    <li>Anis-ul-Arwah</li>
                    <li>Hadis-ul-Ma'arif</li>
                    <li>Risala Maujudia</li>
                    <li>Kanj-ul-Israr</li>
                    <li>Kashf-ul-Israr</li>
                    <li>Afaq-o-Anfas</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Each of these literary treasures serves as a window into the boundless ocean of his inner wisdom and divine connection, reflecting his deep spiritual insight and understanding of the mystical path.</p>
                
                <h3>Islam & Sufism (Tasawwuf): The Path to Divine Oneness</h3>
                
                <p>The essence of true religion, as taught by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, lies in profound obedience and unwavering devotion to the spiritual master. The spiritual guide acts as a sacred conduit, leading the seeker towards internal obedience, with the ultimate guidance emanating directly from God. Religion itself is inherently pure, devoid of contradictions, and emphasizes the liberation of the self from all worldly attachments. A courageous seeker, committed to inner purity, immerses themselves in the true, unadulterated knowledge of God.</p>
                
                <p>Dear seeker, religion is the resonant voice echoing from a deep, distant source, and it is embraced by the sincere individual to ultimately merge with that divine origin. No religion can claim superiority if the seeker remains tethered to mere habits in the initial stages of their journey, for true religion transcends all habitual tendencies. When the sincere seeker experiences profound self-annihilation, their sole desire becomes an unwavering adherence to the religion of their Beloved, for their true religion is nothing but an all-consuming love for The Beloved.</p>
                
                <p>If a spiritual path genuinely leads individuals closer to God, it embodies the true spirit of Islam. Conversely, if it fails to guide one towards the Divine, it is considered to be worse than disbelief. According to those who seek ultimate reality, Islam is the direct path that leads to God, while disbelief is the path that diverts one away from the Divine Presence. However, the truly truthful seeker transcends the confines of any particular religion, and their belonging is not limited to different religious frameworks. Rather, for the people of profound knowledge, there is no other religion than absolute devotion to the truth of Allah.</p>
                
                <h3>Core Teachings from Daleel-ul-Arifeen</h3>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (R.A.) was an inexhaustible source of inspiration and divine illumination. His profound discourses, revealing immense spiritual insight, are meticulously documented in the revered book titled Daleel-ul-Arifeen, compiled by his foremost caliph and Sajjada Nashin, Hazrat Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki of Osh (R.A.).</p>

                        <h4>Mysticism and Mystics: The Inner Life</h4>
                        <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti emphasizes that "Mysticism is a name and not a custom." Merely being conversant with or studying mystical texts does not make one a true Sufi. It is the profound inner life, the transformation of the heart and soul, that truly distinguishes a mystic. A genuine mystic must possess a precise and deep understanding of divine knowledge. They should completely surrender their individual will to the Divine Will of God.</p>

                        <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti teaches that a disciple must wholeheartedly submit their entire self and will to their spiritual guide and teacher. He profoundly observed: "The spiritual disciple should, by earnestly following and obeying his spiritual guide, try to reach the place where the spiritual guide himself becomes the comb of his disciple."</p>

                        <p>According to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.): "The path of love is such, that he who treads on it, loses his name and identity. Love is all-embracing and all-pervading: the lover's heart is a fireplace of love. Whatever comes in it is burnt and becomes annihilated. There is no fire greater in intensity than the fire of love. The sign of true love is manifested in obedience to and the fear of the Friend."</p>

                        <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti profoundly emphasizes the paramount importance of prayer, stating that it is an absolute necessity for the profound development of the soul. He does not restrict the implications, expressions, or meaning of prayer, giving it a broad and expansive connotation. According to him, prayer encompasses selfless service, profound sympathy, and genuine fellow-feeling.</p>

                        <p>According to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, fear, profound respect, and inner shyness are the three essential qualities that contribute to the making of an enlightened being. The perfection of the enlightened soul depends entirely upon the complete loss of the self. An enlightened being is considered perfect only when all barriers separating them from the Divine Friend are utterly dismantled.</p>

                        <p>He places great emphasis on the concept of renunciation, holding that the ultimate objective should be to have no objective at all. To truly lose an objective is, paradoxically, to gain the ultimate objective. A perfect dervish should completely remove from their heart every stain, every stress, and every burden of anything and everything worldly.</p>

                        <p>According to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the real fast is the complete renunciation of all religious and worldly desires, transcending mere physical abstinence.</p>

                        <p>He states that there are three essential conditions attached to Sama (spiritual music); these relate to time, place, and community of interest. It is through Sama that the profound nearness of God is achieved. It bestows divine love upon the heart, imparts sincerity to the intellect, brings unity to the soul, inspires service to the body, and grants divine vision to the eye.</p>

                        <h4>Reality of Kalma: Affirming Divine Oneness</h4>
                        <p>Many utter the sacred phrase "La ilaha illa Allah" (There is no god except Allah) without fully comprehending the profound significance of negation and affirmation. They remain unaware of precisely which aspect is being negated and which is being affirmed. The essence of the term "kalma" conveys the profound notion that nothing truly exists except for the sole, absolute presence of Allah, and Prophet Muhammad ﷺ serves as the ultimate embodiment of Allah's manifestation.</p>

                        <h4>Reality of Namaz (Prayer): Heartfelt Connection</h4>
                        <p>There exist two distinct forms of prayer: one practiced by scholars, jurists, and the self-disciplined, which is primarily confined to external actions and only allows proximity to the realm of angels and the lower self. The other, higher form of prayer is that of prophets, saints, and caliphs, emanating from hearts completely surrendered to the divine. The fruit of this profound prayer is an intimate connection with the divine, and its reach extends to the majestic realm of the soul.</p>

                        <h4>Reality of Fasting: Freedom from Desires</h4>
                        <p>The true definition of the reality of fasting is that a person completely frees their heart from all worldly and religious desires. It means one should be free from the desire for paradise and worldly wealth, etc. Thinking about anything other than Allah, lusting for heaven, etc., are all things that break the true fast.</p>

                        <h4>Reality of Hajj: The Heart as the Abode of God</h4>
                        <p>Man's heart is akin to the Kaaba, as the Prophet ﷺ proclaimed, "The human heart is the abode of the Merciful." Moreover, it is stated elsewhere, "The heart of believers is the throne of the Most High." The very existence of man can be likened to the walls of a sacred home. When the veils of doubt, suspicion, and anything besides Allah are lifted, the resplendent splendor of the Divine will be unveiled within the inner sanctum of the heart. This, indeed, is the true pilgrimage to the Kaaba.</p>

                <h3>Categories of Seekers</h3>
                
                <p>Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti categorizes seekers into four distinct groups:</p>
                
                <ol class="seeker-categories">
                    <li><strong>Arbab e Zahiri (Intellectual Scholars):</strong> This first group consists of worldly individuals known as the "Arbab e Zahiri" or intellectual scholars who adhere strictly to the path of Sharia. They reside on the initial stage of the journey of divine love. If they depart from this world in such a state, their worship remains confined to the material realm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Awam ul-Khaas (Special Individuals):</strong> The second group, known as the "Awam ul-Khaas," comprises special individuals drawn towards spirituality. However, due to their limited understanding of inner knowledge, they often oscillate between worldly pursuits and spiritual yearnings. Their inner vision is not fully illuminated by the inner light. This group is referred to as the "Ahl al-Tariqat."</li>
                    <li><strong>Khawas (People of Truth):</strong> The third group consists of select individuals known as the "Khawas" or the people of truth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Khas al-Khwas (People of Divine Knowledge):</strong> The fourth and most exclusive group is composed of those very special individuals, the "Khas al-Khwas," who are deemed the people of divine knowledge or "Ahl al-Maarifat."</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The grace of divine mysteries is bestowed upon these qualified few. All objects in existence are manifestations of the Divine, and while they are ultimately one, their apparent attributes differ. Similarly, the essence remains singular, yet its manifestations are diverse.</p>

                <p>Each day, the devoted Khadims of Hazrat Khwaja Gharib Nawaz (R.A.) carry out sacred duties within the holy precincts of Dargah Ajmer Sharif. With hearts immersed in divine love, these blessed acts include:</p>

                        <p>The Khidmat of Hazrat Khwāja Gharib Nawāz (R.A.) is performed twice daily by the Khuddām of the Dargāh Sharīf, following the 800-year-old Chishti tradition of devotion and sacred discipline:</p>
                        
                        <h5>Morning Khidmat (Around 4:00 AM, before Fajr):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The main gate of the Dargāh is opened with the Azān. Pilgrims are allowed entry up to the second door, but not inside the sanctum.</li>
                            <li>Fresh Chader (velvet covering) is respectfully placed over the Mazār, replacing the previous one.</li>
                            <li>Fragrant fresh flowers are offered, and the sanctified area is gently cleaned with the Farāsha (a peacock-feather broom).</li>
                            <li>No Sandal or Fateha is performed during this time.</li>
                            <li>The Khadim offers special Dua on behalf of all devotees.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Daytime Khidmat (At 3:00 PM / 2:30 PM on Thursdays):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pilgrims are permitted inside the shrine, except women due to sanctity customs.</li>
                            <li>The ritual includes all morning acts, plus:</li>
                            <li>Application of Sandal (sacred non-alcoholic perfume) on the Mazār-e-Muqaddas</li>
                            <li>Distribution of blessed Sandal to pilgrims</li>
                            <li>Recitation of Fateha, invoking barakah for all</li>

                        <p>Each evening, fifteen minutes before Maghrib (sunset prayer), the spellbinding ritual of Roshnee begins—an ancient tradition of light and reverence at the Mazār-e-Muqaddas of Khwāja Gharib Nawāz (R.A.).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With rhythmic beats of traditional drums, the devoted Khuddām of Ajmer Sharif gracefully enter the sanctified tomb, carrying lit candles with utmost adab (respect).</li>
                            <li>Inside, they recite spiritual Persian couplets, whose sacred words echo through the shrine, invoking deep reverence and divine presence.</li>
                            <li>The candles are then placed into ornately crafted lamps, which are respectfully positioned in the four corners of the holy sanctum.</li>
                            <li>As the candles are lit, the entire chamber glows with a celestial radiance, symbolizing the light of divine love and the eternal Faiz (spiritual grace) of Sultan-ul-Hind.</li>

                        <h4>Karka (Closing)</h4>
                        <p>As the night deepens and silence envelopes the courtyard of Ajmer Sharif, the divine ritual of Karka unfolds—a solemn and majestic ceremony that marks the closing of the Holy Tomb of Hazrat Khwāja Gharib Nawāz (R.A.) each night.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roughly one hour after the Isha prayer, when one-fifth of the night has passed, a designated caretaker gently strikes the clock five times, signaling the moment for all present within the tomb to begin their respectful exit.</li>
                            <li>Once the shrine is vacated, three senior Khuddām step forward to perform the final Khidmat (ritual cleaning) of the night. With devotion and purity of intention, they sweep and cleanse the sacred sanctum—ensuring it rests in sanctity till dawn.</li>
                            <li>As soon as the Khuddām emerge, six chimes ring out in swift succession. In that divine stillness, the voices of the Qawwāls rise in unison with the melodious and mystical rendition of "Karka"—a traditional farewell hymn that echoes with love, longing, and surrender.</li>
                            <li>With the last note of the Karka resonating in the air, the doors of the Mazār-e-Muqaddas are reverently sealed, and the shrine is returned to its celestial silence for the night.</li>

                        <h4>Langer</h4>
                        <p>Each day, the luminous courtyard of Dargāh Ajmer Sharif becomes a sanctuary of divine compassion through the sacred tradition of Langer—free food offered in the name of Khwāja Gharib Nawāz (R.A.) to all, regardless of background, status, or creed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A soul-nourishing wheat porridge is lovingly prepared by the Khuddām, using a special blessed grass, echoing the very recipe once favored by Hazrat Khwāja Moinuddin Chishti (R.A.) himself. This sacred dish carries not only nourishment, but also the spiritual fragrance of simplicity, humility, and love.</li>
                            <li>Even Emperor Akbar the Great, during his historic pilgrimage to the Dargāh, would humbly stand in line among common devotees, awaiting his turn to partake in the same blessed Langer—affirming the eternal equality of all in the court of Gharib Nawāz.</li>
                            <li>The Langer is distributed daily after the Isha prayer, radiating warmth, unity, and divine mercy. It is not merely a meal—it is a spiritual offering, a moment of inclusion, and a taste of the eternal generosity of the Saint of Ajmer.</li>

                <h4>URS Festival</h4>
                
                <p>The Urs festival is a yearly event hosted in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India, dedicated to the remembrance of the passing of the Sufi Saint, Hazrat Moinuddin Chishty (H.A.), who laid the foundation of the Chishtiya Sufi order in India. This festival spans six days and is distinguished by extended night-time sessions of dhikr (zikr), qawwali singing and Langer Niaz. The commemoration takes place during the seventh month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The shrine becomes a site of devotion, drawing thousands of pilgrims from across India and beyond.</p>
                
                <h4>URS Ceremony</h4>
                
                <p>The sixth day of the Urs holds a paramount significance and is regarded as highly auspicious. Referred to as "Chhati Sharif," this day unfolds on the 6th of Rajab, commencing from 10:00 A.M. until 1:30 p.m., within the precincts of the Mazaar Sharif or the shrine complex. This solemn occasion encompasses the reading of the Shijra, the genealogical lineage linked to the Chishti Order, by the devoted Khadims of Moinuddin Chishti. This is followed by Fariyad, the offering of prayers.</p>
                
                <p>Preceding the Qu'l, the culmination of Chhati Sharif, a rendition of RUNG, a poetic ode of praise, resonates at the main entrance of the shrine, performed by the Qawwals. This RUNG, a recitation accompanied solely by rhythmic clapping, including the use of musical instruments. Following its recitation, the Qu'l ceremony reaches its conclusion, and Fatiha is recited. The conclusion of this ceremony is heralded by the firing of a cannon at precisely 1:30 p.m.</p>
