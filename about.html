            <h2>Our Sacred Lineage: Gaddi Nashin of Khwaja Garib Nawaz</h2>
            <p>We are the esteemed Gaddi Nashin (hereditary spiritual torchbearers) of the Holy Shrine of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (H.A.), affectionately known as Khwaja Gharib Nawaz, the Sultan of Hind.</p>
            <p>Our profound connection to this sacred site stems from a direct lineage tracing back to Hazrat Khwaja Syed Fakhruddin Gurdezi Chishti (H.A.), the revered Khadim-e-Khas (chief attendant) and first cousin of Gharib Nawaz (H.A.).</p>
            <p>Hazrat Fakhruddin (R.A.), born in 544 Hijri (1150 AD), was divinely instructed by Hazrat Khwaja Usman Harooni (R.A.) to accompany Khwaja Gharib Nawaz (H.A.) on his spiritual journey to India. Since that pivotal moment, our family‚Äîthe Chishti Syedzadgan (Hereditary Khadim)‚Äîhas dedicated over 800 years of unwavering service to Khwaja Gharib Nawaz, upholding a legacy of devotion and spiritual guardianship.</p>

            <h2>Spiritual Lineage & Historical Legacy: A Timeless Trust</h2>
            <p>Hazrat Khwaja Syed Fakhruddin Gurdezi Chishti (R.A.) held a unique and profound closeness to Khwaja Gharib Nawaz (R.A.) during his lifetime, a fact affirmed by Hazrat Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki (R.A.). Following the Wisaal (passing) of Khwaja Saheb, Hazrat Fakhruddin (R.A.) continued to meticulously manage the Khanqah (Sufi lodge), Langar Khana (community kitchen), and Tosha Khana (storehouse for offerings), ensuring the continuity of the Dargah's operations and spiritual services.</p>
            <p>His passing in Ajmer on 25th Rajab 642 Hijri / 1245 AD marked a significant moment, and his holy tomb rests beside the Mazar-e-Pak, within what is now known as Tosha Khana. The present Khadim families proudly descend from his blessed sons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hazrat Syed Masood (R.A.)</li>
                <li>Hazrat Syed Mahboob Bahlol (R.A.)</li>
                <li>Hazrat Syed Ibrahim (R.A.)</li>
            </ul>
